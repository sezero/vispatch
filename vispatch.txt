VisPatch 1.4.3
------------------------------
A WaterVIS utility for glquake


VisPatch is tool for patching the quake map files for water
transparency in glquake. Original quake didn't have their
maps water-vis'ed, so people did that by themselves and
prepared patch data files. This tool is used for preparing
and applying those patch files.

At the time this tool was written, re-vis'ing maps took a
lot of time, but applying a vispatch took less than minutes,
so this was a necessity. Even today, if people don't want
going into a 'complex' job of vising, this tool comes as a
great convenience because there are a lot of vispatch data
files around.

This is a revised version of Andy Bay's 1.2a source code for
unix and windows, fixing a lot of compilation issues, crashes
and a few other bugs.

The (latest) website for vispatch is:

Usage: vispatch <file> [arguments]

<file> : Level filename pattern, bsp or pak type, wildcards
	 are allowed, relative paths not allowed. See the
	 examples.

 -dir  : Specify the directory that the level files are in.

 -data : Specify the vis data file. Wildcards are not allowed.

 -new  : Tells the program not to overwrite the original level
	 files.  In case of pak files, the patched the levels
	 will be put into a new pak file. In case of standalone
	 maps files, the original maps are renamed to name.bak,
	 and the patched ones are saved as name.bsp .
	 Can not be used in combination with -extract.

 -extract: Retrieve all the vis data from the given file.
	 Can not be used in combination with -new.

IMPORTANT: All files must be of lowercase names for vispatch to
	 find and work with them.

Examples:

vispatch map25.bsp
  Patch and overwrite map25.bsp using vis data from the default
  data file vispatch.dat

vispatch map25.bsp -data map25.vis
  Use map25.vis as the data file instead of vispatch.dat

vispatch -dir hipnotic -data hipnotic.vis
  Patch levels in pak files under the directory named hipnotic,
  using  hipnotic.vis  as the data.

vispatch "*.bsp" -dir hipnotic -data hipnotic.vis
  Patch bsp levels NOT residing in pak files under the directory
  named hipnotic, using  hipnotic.vis  as the data.

vispatch somefile.bsp -extract
  Retrieve all vis data from somefile.bsp and put it into a file
  named vispatch.dat  (If you don't backup any previous one, it
  will append the data into it!)

vispatch somefile.bsp -data some.dat -extract
  Retrieve all vis data from the somefile.bsp and dump it into
  a file named some.dat instead of vispatch.dat

vispatch "*.bsp" -data some.dat -extract
  Retrieve all vis data from all bsp level files and put them
  into the file some.dat

vispatch -dir hipnotic -extract
  Retrieve all vis data from the levels residing in pak files in
  the directory hipnotic, and put them into vispatch.dat
